# Pazzfraze

Generate simple [XKCD-style](https://xkcd.com/936/) passwords using a master
password and a domain name. Available as a GitHub page at
[negamartin.github.io/pazzfraze](https://negamartin.github.io/pazzfraze).

This means that as long as you use the generated passwords frequently, you will
remember both the master password *and* some of the generated passwords (at
least those for your most commonly used sites).

All computation takes place on the client side, and to the best of my knowledge
this should be secure, but there are **absolutely no guarantees** given with
this page, and any loss that results from it is your own fault.
